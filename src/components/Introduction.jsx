					“Relearn” is a course that teaches you to build a strong foundation in

					Before I learned how to design icons myself, I always imagined that
					they were drawn by hand using the pen tool, some sort of fancy
					graphics tablet, and hours and hours spent manually fine-tuning bezier
					curves.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					But it turns out this isn’t how great icon designers work at all.

				<p className="mt-4">
					In “Relearn”, you'll acquire the skills and knowledge needed to create
					web applications and design scalable systems that can meet the demands
					of users and businesses alike.
